# ToDo: Find out how to compile with an .hpp File or something like that

# robcgal_test

# What you need:
- First of all you need CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)
- After you completed their tutorial feel free to test that small program
- Don't forget to create a CMakeLists with the script from CGAL itself and build it now with:
```bash 
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
make
```


# ToDo:
- trying with std::normal_distribution
	- doing more runs and safe the results
- count how often we need to dice till solution
- dicing loc at first after that expand radius
	- currently complete other way
